# DNA-motif-finder

This project is an implementation of a heuristic algorithm for detecting shared motifs within DNA sequences. The algorithm processes input sequences in FASTA format along with quality score files (.qual), and uses a graph-based algorithm to identify common subsequences that appear across multiple sequences.
